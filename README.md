Slept as sound as a bug in a barrell of ==morphine=={Q81225}. Donned a boiled and starched emblem of respectability Eat food for breakfast, Weather delightful— Canary seed orchestra started up with same old tune, ancestors of this bird sang the self same tune 6000 years ago to Adam down on the Euphrates, way back when Abel got a situation as the first angel— Read Sunday Herald, learned of **John Roache's** failure—am sorry—he has been pursued with great malignity by newspapers and others, from ignorance I think— Americans ought to be proud of Roach who started life as a day laborer and became the giant of industry and the greatest shipbuilder in the United States employing thousands of men and feeding innumerable families— what has he now for this 40 years of incessant work and worry People who hound such men as these I would invent a special Hadaes. I would stricken them with the **chronic sciatic neuralagia** and cause them to wander forever stark naked within the artic circle— Saw in same paper account of base ball match, this struck me as something unusual—Read more about that immeasurable immensity of tact and beauty **Madame**

**Recamier**. I would like to see such a woman Nature seems to be running her factory on another style of goods nowdays and wont switch back until long after Im baldheaded— **Damon** went out to assist the tide in— **Daisy** told me something about a man who kept livery stable in Venice. In afternoon went out in yacht, on first trip all our folks and lot of smaller people sailed around for an hour returned and landed the abreviated people— Started for Cottage Park where we took on board the Charming **Mrs Roberts** **brévet Recamier**, and a large lady friend whose name has twice got up and jumped out of my mind. Then sailed away for Rock buoy and for some ocult reason Damon didnt stop and change his mind but headed for Liverpool went out two miles in ocean, undulations threatened to disturb the stability of the dinner of divers persons, returned at 7 pm. Then Damon took out a boat load of Slaves of the Kitchin— Damon and I after his return study plans for our Floridian bower in the lowlands of the peninsular Eden, within that charmed zone of beauty, where wafted from the table lands of the Oronoco and the dark Carib sea, perfumed zephyrs forever

kiss the gorgeous flora, Rats!— Damon took the plans to Boston to place them into the hands of an archetectualist to be reduced to a paper reality— Damon promised to ascertain probable cost chartering schooner to plough the Spanish main loaded with our hen coops— Dot came in and gave us a lot of girlish philosophy which amused us greatly— Oh dear this celestial mud ball has made another revolution and no photograph yet received from the Chataquain Parragon of Perfection. How much longer will Hope dance on my intellect Miss Igoe told me of a picture she had taken on a rock at Panama NY. There were several others in the group, interpolated so as to dilute the effect of ==Mina's=={Q22087338} beauty, as she stated the picture was taken on a rock I immediately brought my scientific imagination to work to ascertain how the artist could have flowed collodion over a rock and put so many people inside his camera. Miss Igoe kindly corrected her explanation by stating that a picture was taken by a camera of a group on a rock. Thus my mind was brought back from a suspicion of her verbal integrity to a belief in the honesty of her narrative

After supper ==Mrs. G=={Q117536483}, Daisy and **Louise** with myself as an incidental appendage walked over to the town of Ocean Spray, went into a drug store and bought some alleged candy, asked the gilded youth with the usual vacuous expression, if he had any **nitric peroxide**, he gave a wild stare of incomphrensibility Then I simplified the name to nitric acid, which I hoped was within the scope of his understanding a faint gleam of intelligence crept over his face whereupon he went into another room from which he returned with the remark that he didnt keep nitric acid— Fancy a drug store without nitric acid. A drug store nowdays seems to consist of a frontage of Red blue and green demijohns a soda fountain, Case with candy and toothbrushes, a lot of almost empty bottles with death and stomachatic destruction written in latin on them, all in charge of a young man with a hatch shaped head, hair parted laid out by a civil engineer, and a blank stare of mediocrity on his face, that by comparison would cause a gum indian in the ==Eden Musée=={Q2425363} look intellectual— On our return I carried the terrealbian gum drops,—moon was

shining brightly girls called my attention several times to beauty of the light from said moon shining upon the waters, couldnt appreciate it, was so busy taking a mental triangulation of the moon the two sides of said triangle meeting the base line of the earth at **Woodside** and ==Akron, Ohio=={Q163132}. Miss Igoe told us about her love of ancient literature, how she loved to read latin, but couldn't. I told her I was so fond of Greek that I always rushed for the comedies of Aristophanes to read whenever I had the jumping toothache. Bed Mina, Morning.
